## Architectural Decisions

 - NodeJs was used because it it easy to setup and create a server with.
 - Express a nodeJs framework was used because it is very easy to setup a light weight server and it comes with routing out of the box
 - Typescript was used to add type safety to javascript
 - socket.io a nodeJs library was used to add real-time update when changes are detected using web sockets.
 - MongoDB was used as the backend server because it is easy to setup, integrate with node and it is also easy to host on MongoDB's Atlas cloud.
